OneNote is one of the most popular note taking tools currently available cross-platform on desktops and mobile devices. With this API it’s now incredibly easy to incorporate things like note taking, researching, and group planning into your applications.

# How It Works

The OneNote API runs on the Microsoft globally-available cloud, and sends data from your app into the user’s OneDrive. When the API sends the data to the OneNote notebook, it also does things like run OCR (optical character recognition) on images, rendering webpages as snapshot-images, and more. The OneNote API enables your app to capture HTML, images embedded in the request or at a URL, video, audio, email messages, and other common file types. Your app can even capture a snapshot image of a webpage for historical records and archiving.
