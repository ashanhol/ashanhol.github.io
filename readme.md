### Individual Posts:
* Need to check for adinashanholtz.com links and replace with proper site.url links
* Run check for {{ site.url }} and replace with {{site.url}}
* Run check for {{site.url}} links and make sure they have .html extensions
* Fruit Warrior
    * Check all the Code sections and the use of {{site.url}}
        * Also for general issues
    * Images need captions
    * Solved Numbered Lists issue (images break list count) by replacing them with h3 tags
* PAX - has that image that's just not available anywhere

### Global:
* Change image links from WP CDN to local
    * Save Image Assets first
* Convert all .webp into .png, due to compatibility issues with Firefox & other browsers
* Need to add link caption into earlier files via <em> tag hack
    * I think this is done - double check

## Notes:
* May need to doublecheck meta data on posts
* Need to check for broken links on posts
* Doublecheck Timestamps
