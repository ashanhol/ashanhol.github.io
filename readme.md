# Progress Log

## Finished:
* Open Source Team Contribution Process

## Need to Finish:
* FruitWarrior MR

## Currently Working on:
* Contributing to Open Source

## Issues:
* Music Wearables w/ WWC: What to do about unavailable video?
    * I put in a placeholder image w/ the original (unavailable) link for now
* Organize It - ALL NECESSARY: GitHub lacks a way to Underline text that isn't links

## Notes:
* Switched to working on oldest posts first, since newer posts often linked to older posts, and this would result in broken links.
