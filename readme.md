## Issues:

### Posts:
* Five Steps to Making Your First VR Game
    * Image Markdown isn't processing correctly - unclear why
        * Issue appears to be specifically with Jekyll - files look fine in GitHub Repo
    * Some lists are rendering weirdly
* ~Music Wearables w/ WWC: What to do about unavailable video?~
    * ~I put in a placeholder image w/ the original (unavailable) link for now~
* PAX East - "Uh, no thanks" image in original post wasn't available
* OneDrive API - image error

### Global:
* Change image links from WP CDN to local
    * Save Image Assets first
* Convert all .webp into .png, due to compatibility issues with Firefox & other browsers
    * Organize It - Screenshot 4
    * Organize It - Screenshot 14
* Need to add link caption into earlier files via <em> tag hack

## Notes:
* Switched to working on oldest posts first, since newer posts often linked to older posts, and this would result in broken links.
* May need to doublecheck meta data on posts - specifically titles
* Need to check for broken links on posts
* Adjust dates on Dev Diary posts?
    * Should final project post be 1st or last?
* Doublecheck Timestamps
* Defense Brigade Part 2 - should Game Over image have caption?
