# Progress Log

## Finished:
* FruitWarrior MR HoloLens Workshop
* Open Source Team Contribution Process
* Music + Wearables Workshop with Women Who Code
* Getting Started with The OneDrive API

## In-Progress:
* Contributing to Open Source
    * Needs other posts to be added first, or else links will be broken

## Currently Working on:
* Contributing to Open Source

## Issues:
* Music Wearables w/ WWC: What to do about unavailable video?
    * I put in a placeholder image w/ the original (unavailable) link for now
* Organize It - ALL NECESSARY: GitHub lacks a way to Underline text that isn't links

## Notes:
* Switched to working on oldest posts first, since newer posts often linked to older posts, and this would result in broken links.
